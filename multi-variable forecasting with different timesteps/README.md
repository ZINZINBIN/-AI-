# Multi-Variable forecasting with different timesteps
## method
- using different timesteps, model predict power generation for next timestep
- model type: many - to - one
- variable used: temp_obs, ws_obs, humid_obs, power_obs

## future work
- apply for dangjin data(from now, only use ulsan data)
- another method(bagging, boosting) will be applied
